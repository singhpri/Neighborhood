##Neighborhood Project
I have done Neighborhood project as part of Udacity FrontEnd Nanodegree.
This project uses google maps API, YelpFusion API and knockout JS framework to show the preschools in Redmond, WA. Using Yelp API, the preschools in the area are pulled up and marked on the map using markers. Markers open up more information about the preschools in the InfoWindows. You can also run a filter to find schools with specific words in their name. The site is responsive as in when the screen is less than 699px, a hamburger icon lets the user open up the list of the schools.

###Installation
Clone git repository to run the application.
Open index.html in a browser.
